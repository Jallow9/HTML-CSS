## 1. What is the command line interface (CLI)?

The Command Line interface (also known as CLI or shell) is a way to navigate through your computer's content (media, folders, applications, etc.) without a visual user interface. It allows you to type text commands to perform specific tasks. Since you can directly control the computer by typing, many tasks can be performed more quickly, and some tasks can be automated with special commands that loop through and perform the same action on many files.

As a beginning programmer it's important to get familiar with it, as it will teach you how computers work: As a tool that you give instructions to. This is not any different from programming for web development; but instead of writing instructions to the computer directly, you write instructions for browsers to execute.

Please install [Git for Windows] (https://gitforwindows.org) which comes with
an application called *Git BASH* which simulates frequently used CLI commands.

## 2. Introduction to HTML

### Crash course

HTML is the foundation of web development. It is an acronym for **HyperText Markup Language**. It is used to structure content on a webpage. What do we mean by content? Plain text, images, videos, links to other websites, etc. The structure gives content meaning by defining that content as, for example, headings, paragraphs, or images.

In order to learn HTML properly it's important to know what is is. Go through the following videos to learn more about it:

### The commonly used tags

If at any point you came to believe you would have to learn a whole list of tags by heart in order to write great HTML, you are in luck: that's not needed.

The most important thing to know is that the tags are used to **structure content**, or in other words: to decide how each part is organized in order to more easily understand what the page is trying to communicate.

It's useful to memorize this list, but don't feel like you have to learn and memorize _every_ HTML tag. Once you understand the basics, you can easily look up which tag you need.

Check out the following article to find a list of the most commonly used tags: [The Most Commonly Used Tags](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/most-commonly-used-tags-in-html/)

## Semantic HTML

Semantic HTML are HTML tags that introduce meaning to the web page rather than just presentation. For example, a `<p>` tag indicates that the enclosed text is a paragraph. A `<nav>` tag indicates a navigation menu of some kind. Both examples show meaning and structure, in this way it's easier to understand for both the browser and the developer.

This leads to the following insight about writing code: while code is written to produce working software, it should also be written so **other developers can easily read and understand it**. You'll learn more about that later.

Take a look at the following resource to learn more about semantic HTML: [Semantic HTML](https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/semantic-html/)

## 3. Introduction to CSS

### Crash course

CSS is just as important as HTML. It is an acronym for **Cascading Style Sheets**. It is a language created to change the appearance of content. By referring to the HTML tags you can `style` it in various ways: change the font size, increase the height or attach a background image to it.

Go through the following video to get a firmer foundation:

### Where to write it?

There are 3 basic ways to write CSS:

- In an external stylesheet: a `.css` file, that is linked to a `.html` file.
- In the <head> of a `.html` file. This is done using the `<style>` tag.
- As part of the attribute `style` inside any HTML tag.

In practice, you'll always write your CSS in separate `.css` files. This is because you want to make sure **every file has a single purpose**: an HTML file should only contain the content and structure of a page, while a stylesheet should only contain styling rules that apply to a page.

### The box model

"In CSS, everything is a box". This phrase summarizes a central concept in HTML/CSS: the box model. When building a web page each element can be considered a box that has the following properties: `margins`, `borders`, `paddings` and `content`. Starting from the first element within the <body>, everything that comes after will be pushed down (thanks to these 4 properties).

### The cascading effect

The first C in CSS stands for Cascading and it's crucial to learning how to use CSS correctly. Essentially, it means that it matters
(1) **in which order** and
(2) **how specific**
you write CSS rules.
